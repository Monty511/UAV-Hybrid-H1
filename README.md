# UAV-Hybrid-H1
This GitHub repository hosts a project to develop a fixed wing drone using carbon fiber material. The aim of the project is to design and build a drone that is lightweight, strong, and aerodynamic, suitable for various applications such as aerial photography, mapping, surveillance, and more. The project seeks to collaborate with experts in various fields, including aerodynamics, composite materials, electronics, flight controller software, camera systems, etc., to achieve the desired specifications.

The repository contains STL files for the carbon fiber frame, as well as other design and engineering files. Collaborators can contribute to the project by uploading their code, documentation, and other relevant files to the repository. By doing so, the project will be able to efficiently manage the development process, making sure that everyone is on the same page.

The project will require collaboration across multiple areas of expertise to design and build a high-quality fixed wing drone that meets the project's specifications. Aerodynamic experts will work on the shape and form of the drone to minimize drag and optimize lift. Composite materials experts will work on selecting the right type of carbon fiber and designing the frame to ensure maximum strength while minimizing weight. Electronics and software experts will work on designing and integrating the flight controller system, enabling the drone to fly smoothly and autonomously. Additionally, camera system experts will work on selecting the right camera and integrating it with the drone's systems to capture high-quality images and videos.

Using GitHub's version control and collaboration tools, the project aims to manage the development process efficiently and transparently, allowing all collaborators to track progress, contribute to the project, and raise issues or concerns.

The ultimate goal of this fixed wing drone development project is to design and build a high-quality drone that meets the desired specifications and is suitable for various applications. With the help of collaborators across various fields, this project aims to bring together the expertise needed to achieve this goal. This repository provides a platform for open collaboration and knowledge sharing, helping to bring together experts and enthusiasts to work on an exciting project with a shared vision.
